### Causal Discovery in Pyro

This repository contains the code for causal discovery in Pyro. There are two files. One is to find the topological ordering of variables, `rl.py`, and the second is to regress if the data is permuted according to the topological ordering, `regression.py`.

### Dependencies

* Numpy
* Pyro
* OpenAI Gym
* Pytorch
* Tqdm
* Matplotlib

### How to run

Run `python3 rl.py` or `python3 regression.py`.
